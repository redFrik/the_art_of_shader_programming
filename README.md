the art of shader programming
=============================

_for the workshop 'the art of shader programming' at the eye for an ear festival berlin, jun2013_

see <http://www.nkprojekt.de/the-art-of-shader-programming/>

here are instructions and examples for __both__ cinder and processing.  the main focus here will be to use cinder under osx, but if people have problems with xcode, windows and visual c++ or run linux, most of the things will also work with processing.

workshop plan
-------------

* install software (cinder / processing, soundflower / jack)
* quick cinder / processing overview (MyFirstApp / MyFirstSketch)
* introduction to shaders
* basic fragment shader example (shader00noInput)
* fragment shader with audio input (shader01audioInput)
* opengl shapes & basic vertex shader (shader02shapeVertex)
* redEye (<https://github.com/redFrik/redEye>)

the workshop material on this github page (<https://github.com/redFrik/the_art_of_shader_programming>) might be updated once in a while.  so it is worth checking back here a few times after the workshop.


//--installing software
=======================

first we need to get the coding environments.  note: cinder doesn't have official support for linux, so if you're running linux install processing instead.  the examples in the processing folder will be equivalent.
* (osx / win) download and install xcode (4.6.3) form <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>
* (osx / win) download cinder (0.8.5) from <http://libcinder.org/download/>. you can put the cinder folder anywhere but i recommend in your home directory.
* (linux) download and install processing (2.0.1) from <http://processing.org/download/>

we also need to be able to route audio between applications (to cinder from puredata, supercollider etc.).  so if you're on osx, install soundflower.  windows and linux users should install jack.
* (osx) download and install soundflower (1.6.6b) from <http://code.google.com/p/soundflower/>
* (win / linux) install jack from <http://jackaudio.org/download>. see also <http://jackaudio.org/jack_on_windows>

last we need a plain text editor for editing the glsl shader files.  anything will do (textedit, notepad, pico, supercollider etc.).  on osx TextWrangler is a good option and available for free from here <http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html>.

//--quick cinder / processing overview
======================================

cinder (<http://libcinder.org>) is a c++ framework / library.  the standard usage is for coding graphics in opengl (3d) or cairo (2d).  basically cinder do all the boring tasks for you like setting up a window, refreshing the window, build a nice standalone application etc.  it also simplifies many things like mouse interaction, window resizing and cross platform builds as well as include libraries for audio, osc and opencv.

here we will first create a simple program from scratch (instructions for xcode).

first cinder program
--------------------
* find and open the TinderBox application under cinder / tools.
* give your project a name (MyFirstApp) and select where to save it.
* optionally deselect 'create local git repository'. (no need to set up a git repro for this test).
* click next and finish. (no need to add any libraries for this test).
* find the project and open the xcode / MyFirstApp.xcodeproj in xcode.
* expand the menu at the left hand side and select MyFirstAppApp.cpp.
* add this line of code: <code>gl::drawSphere(Vec3f(400.0f, 300.0f, 0.0f), sin(getElapsedSeconds())*100.0f);</code> like in the screenshot below and click run (cmd+r).  you should see your program starting with a back window and a white pulsating blob.

![firstApp](https://raw.github.com/redFrik/the_art_of_shader_programming/master/cinder/firstApp.png)

* now look in the folder xcode / build / debug and you'll find your standalone application.
* go back to xcode and select 'edit scheme' under menu product / scheme (or press cmd+<).  change from debug to release in the build configuration pop-up menu.  click ok to confirm.  now the next time we build and run, the program will be built in release mode.  that means it will run faster and take up less space.
* add some more lines like in this second screenshot.  hit run and you should see four pulsating red circles with varying number of segments.

![firstApp2](https://raw.github.com/redFrik/the_art_of_shader_programming/master/cinder/firstApp2.png)

* now your standalone application will be found in the folder xcode / build / release.

first processing sketch
-----------------------
* start processing and create a new sketch (cmd+n).
* save it somewhere and give it a name (MyFirstSketch).
* type in the code below and click run (cmd+r).  you should see your java application starting with a back window and a white pulsating blob.

![firstSketch](https://raw.github.com/redFrik/the_art_of_shader_programming/master/processing/firstSketch.png)

* change the code to the following, click run and you should see four pulsating red circles with varying number of segments.

//--introduction to shaders
===========================

shaders are programs that run on the graphic card (GPU).  they are quite limited in what they can do, but on the other hand they run super fast and in parallel.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader>

there exist a few different languages for writing shaders:
* glsl (opengl)
* hlsl (directx)
* cg (nivida's opengl+directx)
* arb (outdated assembly language)

here we will use glsl.  the glsl language in turn comes in different versions.  version 1.2 is the most general and compatible, while the newer version 1.3 is slowly taking over.  here we will use 1.2, but if your graphic card supports 1.3, you might want to learn this instead.

basically there are 3 types of shader programs.  you can use or leave them out as you like.  they have different purposes and are executed in order.  first vertex, then geometry and last fragment.

* `vertex shader` - runs once for each vertex in a shape. good for changing the position and colour of individual vertices.
* `geometry shader` - also runs once for each vertex in the shape and can add new vertices dynamically.  we will not do any geometry shaders here (they are still rare and require a modern graphic card to run).
* `fragment shader` (a.k.a. `pixel shader`) - runs once for each pixel in the rasterized shape.  i.e. once per frame for each output pixel.

fragment shaders are probably the easiest to get started with and we will do that here as well.  to get a quick taste of how it works go to <https://www.shadertoy.com> and click 'new shader'.  what you see is a fragment shader acting upon a solid rectangle.
you can play around with the code and press play to see the changes.

there are some special concepts in shader programming.  variables for instance can have of the following so called storage qualifiers...

* `uniform` - means that this variable is an input and will be the same for all fragments.  typically used to send in textures or a time parameter to the shader programs.
* `attribute` - a variable that will be unique for each shader program (typically vertex colour, vertex position,  vertex normal). these are read only and only applies for vertex shaders.
* `varying` - are variables that are shared between vertex and fragment shader programs.  use them for communicating between shader programs. it's important to know that they interpolate internally.

available variable types include (only the more common ones)...

* `float` - floating point values.
* `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` - vectors of different dimensions.
* `mat2`, `mat3`, `mat4` - matrices of different dimensions.
* `sample2D` - textures.

and there are special hardcoded variables (constants, inputs, outputs).  they include...

* `gl_FragColor` - fragment colour as a vec4 (r, g, b, a).
* `gl_Position` - vertex position as a vec4.
* `gl_ModelViewProjectionMatrix` - current view matrix.

and you have built-in functions like...

* `mod`, `floor`, `frac`, `abs`, `max`, `min` - some of the available math functions.
* `sin`, `cos`, `atan`, `pow` - more math functions.
* `step`, `smoothstep` - thresholds.
* `clamp` - clipping.
* `mix` - blending.
* `texture2D` - read a value from a 2d texture.
* `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` - for creating new vectors.
* `length` - magnitude of a vector.
* `distance` - distance between two points.

creating and accessing values in a vector is done like this...
<code>
vec4 col= vec4(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 1.0);
float r= col.r;
float g= col.g;
float b= col.b;
</code>

note: the above is far from complete.  for a much better reference see page 3 and 4 of here... <http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/reference_cards/OpenGL-ES-2_0-Reference-card.pdf>
keep this open in the background while playing with the shader code in the examples below.


//--basic fragment shader example
=================================

fragment shader are the easiest to get started with.  here's the first cinder / processing example using shaders.

* open and run the xcode file `shader00noInput.xcodeproj` or the sketch `shader00noInput.pde`.  note: if something doesn't work, see under 'troubleshooting' below.
* press 'f' to load a fragment shader from the data folder.  try different ones (colors00_frag.glsl, colors01_frag.glsl, etc) and also look at the glsl files in a text editor.
* make a copy of one you like and press 'f' to load it.  now you can edit this glsl fragment shader with a text editor as the program is running.  every time you save, the changes will noticed and the shader automatically reloaded.  if you make an error cinder will display it (processing not).
* press 'i' to show / hide the info text.
* press 'esc' for full screen (cinder only).
* press 'm' to toggle different shapes (draw mode).

so the main shader00noInput program itself is very simple.  it just draws one out of a few simple shapes in opengl, applies the fragment shader and sets the uniform variables.  the additional code in there is about detecting key presses, displaying text info and hot-loading the shader.
if you're comfortable with opengl you can change some things in the main code as well.  use it as a template.
there are only two uniform variables in this first example: iGlobalTime and iResolution.  iGlobalTime is useful for driving animation and iResolution for normalizing xy positions (0-1).

![shader00noInput_colors06](https://raw.github.com/redFrik/the_art_of_shader_programming/master/shader00noInput_colors06.png)

//--fragment shader with audio input
====================================

the second example is a bit more involved but still deals only with fragment shaders.  it takes audio input from the default audio input device and sends data (fft, raw samples, average amplitude) to the fragment shader.

* first make sure some sound is coming in.  either via the built-in microphone or via the line-in.
* open and run the xcode file `shader01audioInput.xcodeproj` or the sketch `shader01audioInput.pde`.
* tap the mic and you should see something happening on the screen (by default a red rectangle connected to amplitude).
* press 'f' to load a fragment shader from the data folder.  try different ones (amp, fft and snd show different techniques) and also look at the glsl files in a text editor.
* make a copy of one you like and press 'f' to load it.  now hack it to pieces.

the main shader01audioInput program is now a little bit more complex.  there are new drawing modes (key 'm') for drawing the raw sound input data as well as the fft spectrum in different ways.  and of course the parts dealing with audio buffers, analysis, fft and textures is new.  you can ignore it for now.
the new really useful features are the three uniform variables: iAmplitude, iChannel0 and iChannel1.  iAmplitude is tracks amplitude (default buffersize is 2048 and that's used here).  iChannel0 is the raw audio samples as a texture (2048x1 by default) and iChannel1 contains a texture with the fft of the same data (1024x1 by default).
btw, the names iChannel0, iGlobalTime etc. were chosen to match the ones found in shadertoy.com.

* now select soundflower as audio input and audio output (in system preferences on osx).
* start some sound synthesis program (supercollider or puredata) and make sure it is generating sound and outputting to soundflower.
* restart the shader01audioInput and you should see the program reacting to the synthesised sounds.
* start soundflowerbed and select 'built-in output' in the menu if you want to hear it at the same time.
* note that the shader01audioInput only reads the left channel and that you might want to play with system volume to adjust the loudness of the audio.  it might make a huge difference for the graphics in shader01audioInput.  also what type of sounds you play will make a difference visually.  simple synthetic sounds that move around in frequency will usually look the best.

//--opengl shapes & basic vertex shader
=========================================

vertex shaders are different from the fragment shaders we used so far.  they deal only with individual vertices and not the pixels within a shape.  they are great for manipulating vertex positions.

* open and run the xcode file `shader02vertex.xcodeproj` or the sketch `shader02vertex.pde`.
* press 'v' to load a vertex shader from the data folder.  try different ones (position) and also look at the glsl files in a text editor.
* make a copy of one you like and press 'v' to load it.  change things and experiment.
* remember you can also load fragment shaders like before and use audio input.

//--redEye
==========

a visualiser with audio and osc input.  based on the examples above.  work in progress...

* download it from <https://github.com/redFrik/redEye>.
* open the supercollider file `redEye_test.scd` to see some of the available osc commands.

troubleshooting
===============
the first thing to check if something doesn't compile is that the cinder path is correct. find 'build settings' and scroll to the bottom.  `CINDER_PATH` must point to your cinder_0.8.5_mac folder.

if problems compiling or linking you should make sure the following (also under 'build settings')...
* Base SDK - Latest OSX
* C++ Language Dialect -> C++ 11 [-std=c++11]
* C++ Standard Library -> libc++ (LLVM C++ standard library with C++11 support)
